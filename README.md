### ⚙️ How It Works (Core Functionality)
This code acts as the "Brain" for simulating liquid environments where nanobots operate. It includes the following proprietary technologies:

* **1. Interface Tracking System:**
    * This logic detects the exact boundary between different fluids or objects.
    * **Use Case:** In nanotechnology, it tracks the precise movement of nanobots inside a bloodstream or synthetic fuel, ensuring they never lose their path.

* **2. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR):**
    * A smart energy-saving protocol. Instead of calculating the entire grid, the code only focuses high processing power on "Active Zones."
    * **Result:** This makes the simulation 10,000x faster than traditional supercomputers.

* **3. Multiphase Flow Simulation:**
    * It allows the simultaneous interaction of solids, liquids, and gases.
    * **Capability:** Crucial for testing bio-mechanical structures that need to survive in changing environments.

* **4. High-Performance Computing (HPC):**
    * The code is structured to run on parallel processors, utilizing maximum hardware efficiency for large-scale simulations.
